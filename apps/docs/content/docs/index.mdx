# Jobbig
[![release](https://github.com/maxscn/jobbig/actions/workflows/release.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/maxscn/jobbig/actions/workflows/release.yml)

\[ˈjɔbːɪɡ\] the swedish word for **bothersome**

> This is the first library I have ever published, I might not get everything right immediately. Before version 1.0.0, there will be breaking changes. Before 1.0.0, I will treat minor versions as major versions and patches as both bug fixes and features.

## Notes about development

Jobbig is currently in early development, but should be usable above version 0.2. Below I will outline which features I am using in production, which features are tested and which features exist but are currently untested. 

Versioning will look like this:

- During 0.2 I will roll out this to a few projects I am working on. 
- During 0.3 I will write unit tests for core concepts. 
- During 0.4 I will write type performance tests.
- During 0.5 I will write proper integration tests 

During 0.x you should install the exact package version, as there can be breaking changes. I will try to keep this to a minimum. 

### Properly tested

I will be writing tests during version 0.2, but have currently not started this. 

### Features me or others verified to be working reliably

- the schedule and publish function without **scheduledAt**
- the use, on and handle functions
- the sqs plugin
- the drizzle store


### Not properly tested at all

- the schedule and publish function with **scheduledAt**
- steps
- retries


## Quick Start

```bash
npm install @jobbig/core       # npm
yarn add @jobbig/core          # yarn
bun add @jobbig/core           # bun
pnpm add @jobbig/core          # pnpm
```

There is also an optional drizzle store, this package might be moved into the core library at some point. 

```bash
npm install @jobbig/drizzle       # npm
yarn add @jobbig/drizzle          # yarn
bun add @jobbig/drizzle           # bun
pnpm add @jobbig/drizzle          # pnpm
```



```typescript
import { Job, Jobbig } from "@jobbig/core";
import { ServerPlugin } from "@jobbig/core/plugins";
import { LocalStore } from "@jobbig/local";
import { z } from "zod";

// 1) Define a job with steps
const processData = Job({
  id: "process-data",
  schema: z.object({
    input: z.number(),
    output: z.number().optional(),
  }),
  run: async ({ ctx }) => {
    await ctx.step.run("preprocess", async () => {
      console.log("Preprocessing input...");
    });

    await ctx.step.run("process", async () => {
      console.log("Processing data...");
    });

    await ctx.step.run("save", async () => {
      console.log("Saving results...");
    });
  },
});

// 2) Instantiate a store
const store = LocalStore({});

// 3) Create Jobbig, register plugins/jobs, and start the server worker
const jobbig = Jobbig({
  store,
  jobs: [processData],
}).use(ServerPlugin());

// 4) Schedule runs
await jobbig.schedule({
  jobId: "process-data",
  data: { input: 42 },
});

// 5) Start processing
jobbig.server();

```

## Concepts

See [Concepts](./docs/concepts) for a full overview of key interfaces: Worker, Orchestrator, Runner, Job, Step, Run, and Store.


## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

# Build all packages
bun run build

# Run the example
cd examples/local
bun run index.ts
```

## Roadmap

After making sure the core library is stable and works well with some good base plugins and tests, the main focus will be to make a studio like drizzle studio, where one can browse, reschedule jobs/events, view statistics about events and other niceties.
